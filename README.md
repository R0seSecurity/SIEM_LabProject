# Mapping of Failed RDP in Azure Sentinel

Outline: Here, we are going to map the failed remote desktop login attempts using Azure sentinel by writing the script in the powershell and connecting with API to get the latitude and longitude of the location. This API will give the location from where the live failed login attempts occuring. In the end, you will get better picture.

**Below are the section we will see:**

Now we will create a virtual machine. Go to search bar and write virtual machine. This machine will be exposed to the intenet and other people will start attacking on it.

# **Create a Virtual machine**

## **Steps to create VM:**

1. Resources Group: Create new resource and give it a name( You can name it any).
2. Virtual machine name : Azuremap ( You can name it any)
3. Region: Select the region where the data center exit.
4. Image: Select the Windows 10 Pro version.
5. Size: Default

1. Then finally, click on the review and create. It will take sometime to deploy the machine.

# **Log Analytics Workspace**

Lets create a log analytics workspace by searching in the search bar.

Purpose:  Link the virtual machince logs to the azure logs analytics. Also, create a custom logs and find out from where it is coming.

### **Steps for log analytics:**

1. Create log  analytics workspcae by clicking on create.
2. Resource Group: Same as created earlier during virtual machine
3. Name: lab-Azuremaps (You can keep it any)
4. Region: Default ( US )

![Screenshot 2023-04-07 202346.jpg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/875fbeed-eb79-4cdd-83c7-eb80ea5aa58b/Screenshot_2023-04-07_202346.jpg)

1. Now click on review and create.

# **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**

Here, we will enable the logs from the virtual machine into the log analytics.

So navigate to search bar and search for Microsoft Defender for Cloud. On the left coloum click on the Environment setting. 

## **Azure Defender plan change**

Select the group and turn on the servers and turn off the sql servers on machine as we will not need. Click on the save.

Now lets open the **log analytics workspace** from search bar. On the left there wil lbe virtual machine select that and click on connect.

Open another tab  with same url (portal.azure.com)

# **Microsoft Sentinel**

Go on the top in search bar and search **microsoft sentinel**. This will be used as a SIEM which will help to visualize the log data.

First step is to click on the create the sentinel workspace. Then select the workspace which we wanted to be connected to our log analytics. By the time it is getting connecting. 

# Virtual Machine

## Open virtual machine:

1. Agian go to search bar and search virtual machine.

![chrome-capture-2023-3-7 (2).gif](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/fa100128-28ae-4aee-b240-080211215f7f/chrome-capture-2023-3-7_(2).gif)

1. Open the virtual machine by double click on the virtual machine name.

![Screenshot 2023-04-06 095241.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/1d7511d5-5237-419d-9621-23ee0b5329a5/Screenshot_2023-04-06_095241.png)

1. Now go to main computer and search Remote Desktop Connection.

Well now paste the Public IP Address. And use the same username and password which was created during virtual machine setup.

1. Now click on the connect and you will be able to access the virtual machine using RDP. Enter the username and connect to the machine.

### **Windows Defender Firewall and advanced security**

Before moving toward the Event viewer to view the logs. First we will change the firewall configuration. 

Search for **Windows Defender Firewall and advanced security**

Will turn off the Firewall state for Domain Profile, Private Profile and Public Profile. This will help others to discover new machine which is being now exposed in outside world.

![Screenshot 2023-04-07 232500.jpg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/a804de44-e779-4641-86fb-d1f9d7312bd4/Screenshot_2023-04-07_232500.jpg)

Now search for the event viewer in the virtual machine. Here there will be Custom logs, Windows logs, Application and Services logs.

In the windows Log 

- Application
- Security
- Setup
- System
- Forwarded Events

Check the security event logs there will be first of all login attempt logs, failed login, successful login and other logs.

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/aa222363-0935-45dc-a74d-975645197ee7/Untitled.png)

Main foucs will be on the Event ID 4645 which is a failed login attempt. You can filter the logs and check the failed attempts. As our machine is exposed to outside world now when people able to discover they will start to login or brute force.

We will try to login again using RDP from main computer. And enter the wrong username and wrong password just for receiving the failed attempt log in the event viewer.

Now go to event viewer â€”- >Security log , in that filter the log using eventid 

This picture shows the EventID 4625 (Failed Logon) and whoe description like which account username person tried to login. However, there is no location mentioned only the IP address we know.

Further process we will see how we can map using Geolocation.

Steps:

1. Go to search bar on the VM and search Windows Powershell ISE.
2. Writing a Windows PowerShell ISE. Copy and paste it in new file and save it!. Here, is the Github link.

In the script there are few sample of failed login attempts. This script gather the geo location of the failed login and create a custom failed logs.

[GitHub - R0seSecurity/SIEM_LabProject](https://github.com/R0seSecurity/SIEM_LabProject)

1. API : Will be different for you dont copy paste same as mine as it wont work. 
2. For API  go to  [https://ipgeolocation.io/signup](https://ipgeolocation.io/signup) and generate your API.
3. Now Run the script and wait for a few minutes to get an Output.

1. Now go to C:\ProgramData\failed_rdp.log.
    
    So the initial will be the sample data which will help to train the analytics workspace and followed by the real ones.
    

# Log Analytics

## Create the Custom Logs

Steps:

1. Go to main computer and search the log analytics workspace.
2. On the left column search custom logs.
3. Click on add custom logs. It will ask the location of the log file. So here we will copy paste the failed_rdp.log file in the notebook and save it in Main computer. 
4. Once selected. Click on Next.
5. Details
    
    Custome Log Name: FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO
    
6. Click on Next

## General Logs Query

Logs

1. Search logs on the left column.
2. Write a Query: 
    
    SecurityEvent
    
    SecurityEvent | where EventID == 4625
    
3. This queries will give the data from the windows log.
    
    

## Failed RDP Logs Query

Write a Query.

FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL

Output: All the failed login attempts.

## Create a Custom field and extract from the raw column

Steps:

1. Write a Query.
    
    FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL
    
    Output: All the failed login attempts.
    
    Now in the result section, select any output row
    
2. Now, right click on the first row and extract the field.
    
    ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/7635b08c-5ff7-4919-8e96-860d0958da2f/Untitled.png)
    
3. In the raw data section, select the latitude value. Mention the Field title: latitude Field Type: Numeric. Then clcik on save.
